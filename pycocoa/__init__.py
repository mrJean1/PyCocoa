u'''A basic, U{ctypes<https://Docs.Python.org/2.7/library/ctypes.html>}-based
Python binding to the I{macOS} Objective-C Cocoa runtime and several other
I{macOS} libraries.

This is the U{cocoa-python<https://GitHub.com/phillip-nguyen/cocoa-python>}
package by I{Phillip Nguyen (C) 2011}, modified, extended, tested,
documented and published with permission under both the U{MIT License
<https://OpenSource.org/licenses/MIT>} and the original U{New BSD License
<https://OpenSource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>}.

Installation
============

To install PyCocoa, type C{pip install PyCocoa} or C{easy_install PyCocoa}
in a terminal window.  Alternatively, download C{PyCocoa-y.m.d.zip} from
U{PyPI<https://PyPI.org/project/PyCocoa>} or
U{GitHub<https://GitHub.com/mrJean1/PyCocoa>}, C{unzip} the downloaded file,
C{cd} to directory C{PyCocoa-y.m.d} and type C{python setup.py install}.  To
run the PyCocoa tests, type C{python setup.py test} or C{python test/run.py}
before or after installation.

Examples U{cocoavlc.py<https://GitHub.com/oaubert/python-vlc/tree/master/examples>}
and I{simple_VLCplayer.py} require installation of the U{VLC App
<https://www.VideoLan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html>} for I{macOS} and the
corresponding U{Python-VLC<https://PyPI.org/project/python-vlc>} binding.

Documentation
=============

In addition to the U{pycocoa<https://PyPI.org/project/PyCocoa>} package,
the distribution files contain several tests, some examples and the
U{documentation <https://mrJean1.GitHub.io/PyCocoa>} (generated by
U{Epydoc<https://PyPI.org/project/epydoc>} using command line
C{epydoc --html --no-private --no-source --name=PyCocoa --url=... -v pycocoa}).

Tests
=====

The tests and examples have only been run with 64-bit Python 3.11.1, 3.9.6, 3.8.10,
and 2.7.18 using U{Python-VLC<https://PyPI.org/project/python-vlc>} 3.0.18, 3.0.12,
3.0.11, 3.0.10, 3.0.8, 3.0.6, 3.0.4 and 2.2.8 (with the compatible U{VLC App
<https://www.VideoLan.org/vlc>} and 3.0.16) on macOS 13.1 Ventura, 12.0.1 Monterey,
11.6.1 and 11.5.2 Big Sur (aka 10.16), 10.15.7 Catalina, 10.14.6 Mojave or 10.13.6
High Sierra.  The tests run with and without C{lazy import} in Python 3.

Python 3.11.1 and 3.9.6 run on Apple Silicon (C{arm64} I{natively}), all other
Python versions run on Intel (C{x86_64}) or Intel I{emulation} (C{"arm64_x86_64"},
see function L{pycocoa.machine}).

Previously, PyCocoa was tested with 64-bit Python 3.10.0, 3.9.1, 3.8.6, 3.8.3, 3.8.1,
3.7.4-6, 3.6.5, 2.7.17 and macOS' 2.7.16.  PyCocoa has I{not been tested} on iOS nor
with 32-bit Python and I{does not work} with U{PyPy<https://PyPy.org>} nor with
U{Intel(R) Python<https://Software.Intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python>}.

Notes
=====

All PyCocoa source code has been statically U{checked
<https://GitHub.com/ActiveState/code/tree/master/recipes/Python/546532_PyChecker_postprocessor>}
with U{PyChecker<https://PyPI.org/project/pychecker>},
U{PyFlakes<https://PyPI.org/project/pyflakes>},
U{PyCodeStyle<https://PyPI.org/project/pycodestyle>} (formerly Pep8) and
U{McCabe<https://PyPI.org/project/mccabe>} using 64-bit Python 2.7.18 and with
U{Flake8<https://PyPI.org/project/flake8>} using 64-bit Python 3.11.1 on macOS
13.1 Ventura.

Some alternatives to PyCocoa are (a) U{PyObjC<https://PyPI.org/project/pyobjc>},
the most comprehensive Python to Objective-C bridge (and included in
U{macOS' Python<https://WikiPedia.org/wiki/PyObjC#History>}), (b)
U{Rubicon-ObjC<https://PyPI.org/project/rubicon-objc>} for Python 3.5+,
taking advantage of Python's new
U{typing<https://Docs.Python.org/3/library/typing.html>} annotations and (c)
U{PyGUI<https://CoSC.Canterbury.AC.NZ/greg.ewing/python_gui>} for I{macOS}
and (d) U{wxPython<https://wxPython.org/pages/overview/index.html>}.
