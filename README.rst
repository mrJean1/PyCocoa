PyCocoa
=======

A basic, ctypes_-based Python binding to the macOS_ Objective-C Cocoa
runtime and several other macOS_ libraries.

This is package `cocoa-python`_ by *Phillip Nguyen (C) 2011*, modified,
extended, tested, documented and published with permission under both
the `MIT License`_ and the original `New BSD License`_.

Installation
============

To install PyCocoa, type ``pip install PyCocoa`` or ``easy_install PyCocoa``
in a terminal window.  Alternatively, download ``PyCocoa-y.m.d.zip`` from
PyPI_ or GitHub_, ``unzip`` the downloaded file, ``cd`` to directory
``PyCocoa-y.m.d`` and type ``python setup.py install``.  To run all PyCocoa
tests, type ``python setup.py test`` before installation.

Examples `cocoavlc.py`_ and *simple_VLCplayer.py* require installation of
the `VLC App`_ and the corresponding `Python-VLC`_ binding.

Documentation
=============

In addition to the pycocoa_ package, the distribution files contain several
tests, some examples and the documentation_ (generated by Epydoc_ using command line
``epydoc --html --no-private --no-source --name=PyCocoa --url=... -v pycocoa``).

Tests
=====

The tests and examples have only been run with 64-bit Python 3.9.0, 3.8.6, 3.7.6
2.7.18 and macOS' 2.7.16 using `Python-VLC`_ 3.0.8, 3.0.6, 3.0.4 and 2.2.8 (with
the compatible `VLC App`_) on macOS 11.0.1 (10.16) Big Sur, 10.15.7 Catalina,
10.14.6 Mojave or 10.13.6 High Sierra.  The tests run *with and without*
``lazy import`` in Python 3.9.0, 3.8.6 and 3.7.6.

Previously, PyCocoa was tested with 64-bit Python 3.8.3, 3.8.1, 3.7.5, 3.7.4,
2.7.16 and 2.7.17.  PyCocoa has *not been tested* on iOS nor with 32-bit Python
and *does not work* with PyPy_ nor with `Intel(R) Python`_.


Notes
=====

All PyCocoa source code has been statically checked_ with PyChecker_, PyFlakes_,
PyCodeStyle_ (formerly Pep8) and McCabe_ using 64-bit Python 2.7.18 and with
Flake8_ using 64-bit Python 3.9.0 on macOS 11.0.1 (10.16) Big Sur.

Some alternatives to PyCocoa are (a) PyObjC_, the most comprehensive Python
to Objective-C bridge (and included in `macOS' Python`_), (b) `Rubicon-ObjC`_
for Python 3.5+, taking advantage of Python's new typing_ annotations, (c)
PyGUI_ for macOS_ and (d) wxPython_.
