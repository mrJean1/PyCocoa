PyCocoa
=======

A basic, partial, ctypes_-based Python binding to the macOS_ Objective-C
Cocoa runtime and several other macOS_ libraries.

This is package `cocoa-python`_ by *Phillip Nguyen (C) 2011*, modified,
extended, tested, documented and published under both the original
`New BSD License`_ and the `MIT License`_.

In addition to the pycocoa_ package, the distribution files contain several
tests, examples and documentation_ (generated by Epydoc_ using command line:
``epydoc --html --no-private --no-source --name=PyCocoa --url=... -v pycocoa``).

Examples `cocoavlc.py`_ and *simple_VLCplayer.py* require installation of
the `VLC App`_ and the corresponding `Python-VLC`_ binding.

The tests and examples have only been run with 64-bit Python 2.7.14 and
3.6.5 (with VLC_ 2.2.6 and 3.0.1) and only on macOS 10.13.4 High Sierra.
PyCocoa has *not* been tested on iOS nor with 32-bit Python.

All PyCocoa source code has been statically checked_ with PyChecker_,
PyFlakes_, PyCodeStyle_ (formerly Pep8) and McCabe_ using 64-bit Python
2.7.14 and with Flake8_ on 64-bit Python 3.6.5.

To install PyCocoa, type ``pip install PyCocoa`` or ``easy_install PyCocoa``
in a terminal window.  Alternatively, download ``PyCocoa-`` from PyPI_
or GitHub_, ``unzip`` the downloaded file, ``cd`` to directory
``PyCocoa-`` and type ``python setup.py install``.  To run all PyCocoa
tests, type ``python setup.py test`` before installation.

Some alternatives to PyCocoa are (a) PyObjC_, the most comprehensive Python
to Objective-C bridge, (b) `Rubicon-ObjC`_ for Python 3.5+, taking advantage
of Python's new typing_ annotations and (c) PyGUI_ for macOS_.
